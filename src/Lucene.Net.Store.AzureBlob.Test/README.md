# Tests for Lucene.Net.Store.AzureBlob

## Important

Running these tests requires an Azure Storage Account, either through the Azure Storage Emulator (the default; Azurite works too)
or by setting the CONNECTION_STRING environment variable to a valid connection string of a Storage Account (or a remote emulator).
